        <section class="about-text">
          <p>
            I am an enthusiastic Data Scientist and Data Analyst. With over
            three years of working experience, I'm currently expanding my knowledge by pursuing a Master's in Data
            Science
            at Fordham University. My passion lies in exploring the intricacies of AI and Federated Learning, the
            nuances of Option
            Pricing through Reinforcement Learning, the potential of Large Language Models, the innovations of AutoML,
            and the
            vast realm of Big Data.
          </p>

          <p>
            Beyond the tools and techniques, it's my innate attention to detail, rapid assimilation of new concepts, and
            a keen
            analytical eye that truly define me. These attributes have not only allowed me to devise novel solutions to
            prevalent
            challenges but also refine my essence as a reliable team collaborator and an adept problem solver. Every
            project I've taken
            under my wing, whether collaborative or solo, has been a testament to my undying commitment and skillset in
            this expansive
            field of study.
